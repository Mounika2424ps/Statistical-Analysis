Statistical analysis is the process of collecting and analyzing data in order to discern patterns and trends. It is a method for removing bias from evaluating data by employing numerical analysis. This technique is useful for collecting the interpretations of research, developing statistical models, and planning surveys and studies.
here,we will explore the basics of statistical analysis using Python, leveraging libraries like pandas, numpy, and scipy. We will use various datasets, including the built-in Diabetes dataset from the sklearn library.
